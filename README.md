# AKS Day 2 – Solution Optimization

This repository provides a structured three‑day set of learning materials focused on optimizing Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) solutions. The goal is to help architects, engineers, and operations teams strengthen Day 2 operational maturity through practical guidance and applied best practices.

## Overview

The included PDFs cover core AKS optimization themes, including:
- Operational excellence and Day 2 readiness
- Security, governance, and cluster hygiene
- Scaling, resiliency, and performance tuning
- Cost optimization and resource efficiency
- Monitoring, troubleshooting, and operational visibility

Each document builds progressively to help teams establish a mature and reliable AKS operational framework.
